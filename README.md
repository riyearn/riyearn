you probably saw me at docks / party island / or basically anywhere, hi. about me down there or just click to my pronouns.page, i'm moreso seen in mafia games alongside with my friends. or just with friends in general, i don't normally play alone. i like c+h'ing with them so like yeah ( queerassiers / snorlax )

you'll find me offtabbed most of the time, unless i'm in a mafia game; i tend to multitask while doing so—w2i unless i'm chatting/talking actively.

**BEFORE YOU FOLLOW，BE WARY..**

i tend to make nsfw & kys / kms / kts jokes, completely disregarding my age. i'm alright with basically *anything* if you're a *close friend* of mine, if not, i might have a problem on how you interact ( i'm not trying to be mean; i **genuinely** can't help it. ) some of my jokes may be regarded as 'dark humor', so i apologize for that. i also jokingly + affectionately + playfully insult others; even if they come off as 'dry', it isn't serious. please don't take my comments to heart! besides that, i'm sensitive easy to rile up and provoke, so, for randos i highly recommend using tone tags on me, and i'll do the same. i also tend to cuss a lot, so please, don't mind asking me to tone it down. i'm not one for 'cd / ct' but i highly advise not to cover my skins with negative intent. 

for randos, use tone tags if wanted. feel free to c+h, interact, or anything of the likes. if you're going c+h, please whisper me so i won't move (^_^). also, i don't respond to whispers unless genuinely needed so i'm sorry for that

**avoid shipping me with my friends. whomever i'm with is a friend, as i don't have a partner.**

#

**REFRAIN FROM INTERACTING.**

i don't really have a list; but just don't be under 11>, i don't mind those who're adults. and don't be a weirdo and/or a bigot or whatever. also don't be a certain someone named 'vee'.
