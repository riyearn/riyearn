you probably saw me at docks / party island / or basically anywhere, hi. 

about me down there or just click to my pronouns.page, i'm moreso seen in mafia games alongside with my friends. or just with friends in general. or you just happen to click my pony and get curious. i like c+h'ing with them so like yeah ( queerassiers / snorlax )

you'll find me offtabbed most of the time, unless i'm in a mafia game; i tend to multitask while doing so—w2i unless i'm chatting/talking actively.

**BEFORE YOU FOLLOW，BE WARY..**

i tend to make nsfw & kys / kms / kts jokes, completely disregarding my age. 

i'm alright with basically *anything* if you're a *close friend* of mine, if not, i might have a problem on how you interact if it leans moreover to the 'negative' side ( i'm not trying to be mean; i **genuinely** can't help it. )

some of my jokes may be regarded as 'dark humor', so i apologize for that. i also jokingly + affectionately + playfully insult others; even if they come off as 'dry', it isn't serious. please don't take my comments to heart! besides that, i'm sensitive easy to rile up and provoke, so, for randos i highly recommend using tone tags on me, and i'll do the same.

i also tend to cuss a lot, so please, don't mind asking me to tone it down. 

i'm not one for 'cd / ct' but i'd prefer if you wouldn't cover me ( unless a friend )

for randos, use tone tags if wanted. feel free to c+h, interact, or anything of the likes. if you're going c+h, i wouldn't rlly mind (^_^). but, i'm not actively seeking friends and i have social anxiety despite being on the digital world

**avoid shipping me with my friends. whomever i'm with is a friend, as i don't have a partner.**

#

**REFRAIN FROM INTERACTING.**

i don't really have a list; but just don't be under 11>, i don't mind those who're adults. and don't be a weirdo and/or a bigot or whatever. basic dni criteria also lol i won't toler8 ppl who r like befitting that same criteria. also don't be a person of problematic media

**YOU'RE OKAY.**

anyone with the user '@yurispew'. tt / td folks ( ponytown ). ken / ranb.
